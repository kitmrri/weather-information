# Vue.js with Axios and Tailwind

This frontend SPA application is built using Tailwind CSS for styling and Vue.js as the JavaScript framework. Axios is used to make API calls to the backend and access the database. 

I used tailwind because it is a highly optimized and performance-focused CSS framework, providing a fast and efficient way to style the application. This also makes modifying the looks more trivial due to its rich documentation.

Vue.js offers a reactive and flexible approach to frontend development, allowing for smooth and seamless updates to the user interface. This satisfies the `reactive` requirement of the application. Using it with `Axios` makes it very easy and simple to access the backend and database. This allows for a quick and easy retrieval of the required data.

## UI/UX Implementation
I styled the application this way for the users to quickly see all the details they are looking for at a glance. I also added a `link to google maps` on each of the Restaurant and Tourist Attractions in the list. There is also a sidebar navigation on the left side for users to quickly change City that they want to look at.

## Features
* Utilizes the power of Tailwind CSS for fast and efficient styling
* Vue.js provides a reactive and efficient way to handle the frontend logic

## Conclusion
The use of Tailwind CSS, Vue.js, and Axios provides a powerful and efficient solution for the frontend of this application. The combination of these technologies ensures a fast, reactive, and user-friendly experience for the end-user.
